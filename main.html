	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

	<p>
		Time complexity describes how efficient an algorithm is based on the time it takes to execute
        as the input size increases. Understanding Time complexity helps developers write efficient code.
	</p>

	<p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution.
        An algorithm that uses memory proportional to input size is said to have Space Complexity of O(n).
